Separate plugin: Build & place used/deprecated ships with degraded base stats; add shipyards on some planets that only sell used ships. Use this, then rebuild the shipyard:
		shipyard clear

Separate plugin: makes licensed ships available at 5x price without a license on select pirate worlds (identical variant with higher hull price). Add description addendums to variants of vanilla ships which previously could not be purchased.

	Misc. tweaks:
* Add nitrogen cooling to Valhalla
* Change Bactrian license to be granted on defeating pirate king for the Deep. Other bactrian missions could give shield regenerators, advanced weapons (Project Hawking), ionic afterburners.
